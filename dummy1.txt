My first Github experience
  sooo for it i will write a code to add two numbers in javascript
  let a=10;
  let b=20;
  console.log(a+b);
ok the next lines are the next commit code
  soo for it i am going to write the famous Hello world
but let us make it a bit dramatic
soo we will write the code so that it will print all the letters in it
let a='Hello World';
for (let i=0;i<a.length;i++) {
  console.log(a[i]);
}
